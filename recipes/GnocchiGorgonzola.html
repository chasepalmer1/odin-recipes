    <ol class = "maintext">
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, olive oil and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a medium Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the butter and allow to melt. 
            Add the shallot and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring often, until the shallot is fragrant and beginning to soften, about 2 minutes. 
            Whisk in the flour and cook for another minute. Slowly whisk in the milk for a smooth sauce. Add the bay leaf and simmer for 5 minutes, whisking occasionally. 
            Whisk in the Gorgonzola until smooth. Add the gnocchi and stir to coat. Pour the mixture into an 8-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with the breadcrumb topping and bake until golden brown and bubbly, about 25 minutes. 
            Allow to sit for 5 minutes before serving.
